As a environmental exposure researcher, I often come across a variety of questions on where and when are people located because I want to know their locations and duration when they expose to some environmental hazards for example air pollution. Therefore, I have used many tools for my studies such as self-reported locations, maps from survey and satellite images . A typical work flow in my area is: 1. Knowing the address of participants from questionnaire. 2. Geocoding the addresses into latitude and longitude. 3.Merging the locations with environmental expsoures by time and spcae.
